## Continuous: Past, present, and future

On Saturday, July 29th, at 12:15 (Turing â€“ G29)

Since 2012, a service in the GNOME infrastructure has been constantly
building GNOME modules, committing the result to Ostree, and running
automated tests on the whole OS. From a single Git commit to a full blown
virtual machine in a matter of minutes. This service is called GNOME
Continuous, our own continuous integration and delivery pipeline.

Continuous has been the major driver to improve the quality of the whole
GNOME project: for developers, by building their work; for designers, by
providing a bootable VM to perform design iteration and QA; to newcomers, by
ensuring that tools like jhbuild would be more reliable; to distributors and
OSVs, who could ensure their products would be based on a reliable set of
components.

In this presentation we will talk about how Continuous came to be, thanks to
the work of Colin Walters; how it works; what are the goals of a CI/CD
pipeline like Continuous; and where do we go from here.
